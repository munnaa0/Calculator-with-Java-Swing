This calculator is capable of doing basic Addition,Subtracktion, Multiplication and Division. It can be also used to calculate Percentage.
It can calculate decimal values and also capable of fixing type error by deleting last number or digits or using C to delete all.
This Calculator is capable of remembering the last Calculation Answer so you can use that to calculate Further.

This is the first Complete Java Swing Program of Mine.
